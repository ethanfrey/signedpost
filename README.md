# Signed Post

Demo app using the tendermint blockchain.

This allows people to sign posts using their public key.  In the most banal sense, this is an 
immutible blogging platform on the blockchain.  And as such, serve as a demo for building an
interactive web-app based on tendermint technology.

However, it is also designed to provide legally valid proof of the existence of any document 
at a given time, backed by the validation of a shared blockchain. When combined with proof of 
real-world identity tied to a public-key, this could actually be a useful tool.

An old-fashioned version was to send yourself a sealed letter and use the stamp from the post office
on the sealed envelope as proof as to the date of the document.  This is a high-tech version for
signing your post.
